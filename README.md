******************************************************************************************************************************************
These are some of the programs I coded in my AP Computer Science class. We used Java for all of the programs and I used Repl.it for most of the year and have just recently switched to Eclipse. Java is the most practical language I think I've learned so far (not to say my other languages aren't practical).
